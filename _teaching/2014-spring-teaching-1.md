This is an applied quantitative biology course with a focus on proper methodology for study design and statistical analysis in biological research. The course topic involved foundation in statistical analyses and study design, biomedical image quantification analysis, and cancer genomics analysis. I led weekly workshops to expand on the lectures, discuss problem solving strategies, and demonstrate basic analyses. Additionally, I held office hours and graded examinations.
